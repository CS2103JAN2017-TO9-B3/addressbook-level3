HiTask:
     HiTask is a team project management and task collaboration, I think this feature is not suitable for Jim,
         since Jim usually work alone.
     HiTask has data backup, I think this feature is suitable for Jim,
         since Jim is a forgetful person, he might delete some important task accidentally.
     HiTask can synch with google calendar, I think this is useful since Jim may have plenty tasks,
         he might need to rely heavily on google calendar to help him organize his schedule.
     HiTask is easy to use, available in office, at home and on the road. I think this is useful for Jim,
         Jim is a busy man, so he might use his free time like on his way to work or back home to check his
         schedule.
